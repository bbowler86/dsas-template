#### Models Directory
This directory is used for storing the final output of the models and any preprocessing objects (e.g. TF-IDF vectorizers, word vectorizers, etc.) that are used for predicting with the model.

In Python, objects can either be [pickled]([https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)) or saved through the various libraries that might be used. 

Below are links to these features in several of Machine Learning packages in Python: 
* [keras](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html)
