#### Data Directory
This point of having a directory like this will be to store all of the data that you use in your project. The structure of this directory contains several subdirectories:
```
./data
├── raw
├── external
├── interim
└── processed
```
<b>Raw:</b>
Contains the raw data files for a project.
<b>External:</b>
Contain data sets that are from external sources.
<b>Interim:</b>
Contain files that are for storing the interim files created during the preprocessing pipeline.
<b>Processed:</b>
Contains the final processed files that are used for analysis and building models.
